 * Without this a phone lays the page out at 980px and scales it down, which
 * turns every control into something you have to pinch at. `viewportFit`
 * lets the game reach under the notch; the safe-area insets in the CSS keep
 * anything you need to press out from under it.
 *
 * Zoom is deliberately left alone: the game surface blocks pinch and
 * double-tap through `touch-action`, so there is no need to take it away
 * from the rest of the page.
