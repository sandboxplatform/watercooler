/**
 * The businesses, their buildings, and where those stand on the world map.
 *
 * Three ideas, kept apart:
 *
 * - An *organisation* is who you work for. It is the home a person chooses
 *   and the thing a resident agent belongs to.
 * - A *tenant* is one enterable room. A head office is a lobby with floors
 *   above it; a building supply business is a store, with its warehouse and
 *   garage as rooms behind it; a campus has a department lobby, a store and
 *   a garage per little building on its yard.
 * - A *building* on the world map is an organisation's front door. It leads
 *   straight into a room — a lobby or a store — or onto a campus: a yard of
 *   little buildings, one per tenant, which is that organisation's menu.
 *
 * Shared by the scenes and the HUD, so nothing here touches Phaser.
