/**
 * Floors.
 *
 * A building has a lobby — the main floor everyone arrives on — and two
 * floors above it: Floor 1, where the building's people have their desks,
 * and Floor 2, where its agents do. The lift is how you move between them.
 * Each floor is its own room (see lib/rooms.ts), with its own people and
 * conversation.
 *
 * URLs carry the whole address:
 *   /r/<slug>            the lobby
 *   /r/<slug>/floor/1    the people's floor
 *   /r/<slug>/floor/2    the agents' floor
 *   /r/<slug>/floor/3    the board floor, in a building that has one
 * Add ?via=elevator to step out of the lift, or ?via=door to step in from
 * outside; either way you arrive walking, and clear of the doorway.
 *
 * Nothing here touches Phaser or the DOM.
