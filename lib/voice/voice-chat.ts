/**
 * One voice chat for the whole server.
 *
 * Audio goes browser to browser over WebRTC; the room socket carries only
 * the handshake, and the server never hears a thing. Switching a microphone
 * on joins the one conversation everybody on the server is in — a mesh,
 * which is fine while the cast is small — and everyone in it is heard in
 * full, wherever in the world they are standing.
 *
 * It used to be one conversation per room, each voice turned down by how
 * far away its owner stood. Distance is the wrong measure once the chat
 * spans rooms: a floor above has coordinates of its own, so the same
 * numbers mean something different in every place, and a person you can
 * hear at all is a person you should hear properly. The fade is gone with
 * it; `proximity.ts` says what it was, for whenever it comes back.
 *
 * Who is on the server, rather than who is in this room, is `presence-online`:
 * the same list the People panel shows, which the server sends to everybody
 * whenever anyone arrives, leaves or walks somewhere else.
 *
 * One instance per browser. It listens to the room socket for as long as
 * the HUD is mounted, and does nothing at all until the microphone is
 * switched on.
